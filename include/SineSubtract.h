/**************************************************************************************
 * \class FFTtools::SineSubtract 
 *
 * \brief This class contains an independent implementation of the sine
 * subtraction CW removal algorithm, suggested by Andres/ Steph
 * (ANITA Elog 621).
 *
 * Cosmin Deaconu <cozzyd@kicp.uchicago.edu> is responsible for this mess. 
 *  
 * This, SineSubtract,  is the controlling class. Related classes are
 * SineFitter, which does the minimization, SineFitter::SineFitFn, which
 * provides the objective function and its derivative, SineFitterLimits, which
 * encodes parameter limits, and SineSubtractResult, which stores stuff. 
 *
 * Many options are available, some of which may even be documented. For
 * example, the part of the waveform used to train sine subtraction may be
 * limited (e.g. if you wanted to just use the non-trigger portion).  Multiple
 * waveforms may be fit for at once (a single frequency is fit for in each
 * iteration, with the amplitude and phase allowed to vary per waveform). It is
 * also possible to enable storage of intermediate graphs and power spectra at
 * each step.  This is useful for diagnostics and making pretty plots, but
 * incurs some overhead, so is not recommended for production use.
 * Gratuitously, there are methods to generate plots and even Beamer slides. 
 *
 * A sketch of the algorithm is: 
 *
 *    - Rectify waveform and estimate power spectrum (according to the power spectrum option). 
 *
 *    - Find peak, fmax, in power spectrum by finding max magnitude/(1+nfails)^nfails_exp) , 
 *      according to the peak finding option. See below for meaning of nfails. 
 *
 *    - Find sine ( A (sin wt + phi)) that when subtracted minimizes "power"
 *    (avg(v_i^2)); initialize with w = 2pi fmax, A = mag, phase from fft.
 *    Uninterpolated graph is used for this! 
 *
 *    - If power reduced by more than min_power_reduction, subtract 
 *
 *    - If power not reduced by more than min_power reduction, increment nfails
 *    for that bin 
 *
 *    - Repeat until max_iter_without_reduction iterations with not enough
 *    improvement   
 *
 * 
 * --- 
 *
 *  A lot of time has been spent profiling and trying to make this run as fast
 *  as possible. This results in code that is more difficult to understand than
 *  a naive implementation would allow. Any suggestions for performance
 *  enhancements are awelcome. 
 * 
 *  If ENABLE_VECTORIZE is defined, custom vectorized code (using Agner Fog's
 *  VCL, http://www.agner.org/optimize/#vectorclass) is used for the objective
 *  function and gradient.  At least until compilers get smart enough to
 *  autovectorize stuff better, this is substantially faster, but obviously
 *  only makes sense in a processor with SIMD instructions.  256-bit floating
 *  point registers are used (e.g. AVX) but the VCL will gracefully fallback to
 *  128-bit registers at compile time should your processor be too old. At some
 *  point AVX-512 will appear, so that might require a few changes. 
 *
 *  **WARNING**: You will not get the same "answers" in vectorized mode. This
 *  is expected, due to usage of different math functions and the general
 *  non-associativity of of floating point math. 
 *
 * ---
 *
 *  A number of additional compile-time options influence the behavior: 
 *
 *  - If SINE_SUBTRACT_USE_FLOATS is defined, the fitter will use floats
 *  instead of doubles. In principle, this should be twice the vectorization,
*  but in practice, the overhead of copying and casting seems to be
*  problematic. 
 *
 *  - If SINE_SUBTRACT_FORCE_ALIGNED is defined, the fitter will copy the
 *  doubles into an aligned array. This might make a performance difference on
 *  old processors, but seems to not help for the most part. 
 *  
 *  - If SINE_SUBTRACT_PROFILE is defined, the time spent calling subtractCW is
 *  printed. 
 *
 *  - if SINE_SUBTRACT_DONT_HORIZONTAL_ADD is defined, horizontal addition is
 *  disabled.  You probably don't want to do this, I added this when I was
 *  investigating some strange numerical behavior. 
 *
 *  See macros/testArtificialSubtract.C to see SineSubtract in action.  
 *
 * --- 
 *
 * TODO list: 
 *
 *  - Better  tuning of default step sizes / limits ? 
 *
 *  - Minuit2 adds quite a bit of overhead, and is one of the things preventing
 *  this from running even faster
